Firstly, my heartfelt gratitude for this amazing design template, that can be found at [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).

A very short introduction:

[This pretty much covers everything](https://sammitjain.github.io/files/Resume_SammitJain.pdf). 

A short introduction:
======
I try my best to keep this introduction as current as possible. As of Monday, 6th April, 2020, I've been contributing at MathWorks as a Software Engineer (Semantic Search) with the Simulink Search and Diagnostics team. My current project revolves around custom Named Entity Recognition, and thus spans fields like Natual Language Processing, Search Algorithms, Deep Learning, Optimization and Programming in C++/MATLAB/Python.

Earlier in Spring 2019, I got an opportunity to work as a Research Fellow with Prof. Jean-Christoph Olivo-Marin, Head of the Bioimage Analysis Group, Department of Cell Biology and Infection, [Institut Pasteur, Paris](https://www.pasteur.fr/en). We worked on Dendritic Spine Segmentation, which spanned a multitude of disciplines like algorithmic design, partial differential equations, optimization, differential geometry, coordinate geometry and biology. The work was accepted for ISBI 2020, and can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08809.pdf).

I was a Visiting Research Fellow (Fall 2018) at The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY), with [Prof. Robert Haralick](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HMnF6i0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the Department of Computer Science. 

My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning, especially when they intertwine with applications in biology.

I graduated from BITS PILANI University in India, in May 2019 with a rather odd choice of two degrees - A Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (B.E. EEE) and a Masters in Mathematics (MSc. Mathematics).

Why Electronics and Mathematics? Where does Biology fit in?
======

My decision to pursue mathematics was a simple one. Mathematics is probably one of the most misunderstood sciences, I believe. With people belonging to factions as varied as "Mathematics is the queen of sciences" and "Mathematics has no real application", there's hardly anything that hasn't been said about Mathematics. My personal stance is that, it makes me think, and I'll leave it at that. Pursuing Electrical and Electronics Engineering, simultaneously, my mind has opened up to the blinding number of instances mathematics has made life easier for engineers. It's really hard to understate the impact Mathematics has had on me. 

Additionally, throughout my 5 years of college, I developed a taste for biology, and I could never quite fathom how closely Biology and Math are related. With one of my professors modelling diseases using partial differential equations, and optimization, it is amazing how things have a way of coming together well if we don't waste time thinking about if and where those things really belong.

My academic interests include
======
* Natural Language Processing
* Image Processing 
* Computer Vision
* Biomedical Imaging
* Numerical Analysis / Methods for ODEs and PDEs
* Operations Research / Optimization
* Digital Signal Processing
* Programming in MATLAB, C, C++, Python

I can talk to you endlessly about...
------
* VIM - There really is no competition. (Emacs and VSCode users, I'm looking at you)
* Football (soccer) 
* Stand-up comedy
* Quizzing. No knowledge is ever truly useless, as I've come to believe. 

Still want to know more?
