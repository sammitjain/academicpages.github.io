Firstly, my heartfelt gratitude for this amazing design template, that can be found at [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).

A very short introduction:
=====
[This pretty much covers everything](https://sammitjain.github.io/files/Resume_SammitJain.pdf). 

A short introduction:
======
I'm currently a Visiting Research Fellow (Fall 2018) at The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY), working with [Prof. Robert Haralick](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HMnF6i0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the Department of Computer Science. My research interests include Image Processing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning, especially when they intertwine with applications in biology. I was also previously an EDGer for MathWorks (yes, it's the company that makes MATLAB) and a Research Intern at DRDO, Delhi. 

I'll be graduating from BITS PILANI University in India, in May 2019 with a rather odd choice of two degrees - A Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (B.E. EEE) and a Masters in Mathematics (MSc. Mathematics).

In Spring 2019, I will be working as a Research Fellow with Prof. Jean-Christoph Olivo-Marin, Head of the Bioimage Analysis Group, Department of Cell Biology and Infection, Institut Pasteur, Paris. 

Why Electronics and Mathematics? Where does Biology fit in?
======

My decision to pursue mathematics was a simple one. Mathematics is probably one of the most misunderstood sciences, I believe. With people belonging to factions as varied as "Mathematics is the queen of sciences" and "Mathematics has no real application", there's hardly anything that hasn't been said about Mathematics. My personal stance is that, it makes me think, and I'll leave it at that. Pursuing Electrical and Electronics Engineering, simultaneously, my mind has opened up to the blinding number of instances mathematics has made life easier for engineers. It's really hard to understate the impact Mathematics has had on me. 

Additionally, throughout these 4 years, I've also developed a taste for biology, and I can never quite fathom how closely Biology and Math are related. With one of my professors modelling diseases using partial differential equations, and optimization, it is amazing how things have a way of coming together well if we don't waste time thinking about if and where those things really belong.

My academic interests include
======
* Image Processing 
* Computer Vision
* Biomedical Imaging
* Numerical Analysis / Methods for ODEs and PDEs
* Operations Research / Optimization
* Digital Signal Processing
* Programming in MATLAB, C, C++, Python

I can talk to you endlessly about...
------
* Football (soccer). 
* Stand-up comedy. Major league stand-up comedy enthusiast. Let's talk about George Carlin, Jimmy Carr, Bill Burr, Bill Hicks and Billy Connolly. 
* Quizzing. No knowledge is ever truly useless, as I've come to believe. 

Still want to know more?
